### Session Abstract

The traditional IT operations workflow has always relied on a process and procedure cycle that ultimately requires manual intervention to restore production services and resolve an active incident.

In this session, we will explore how the combination of Event-Driven Ansible, application telemetry, and a solid foundation of observability can be combined to deliver the ultimate in closed-loop automation to reduce incidents and after-hours troubleshooting.
