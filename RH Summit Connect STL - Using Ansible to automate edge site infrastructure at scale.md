### Session Abstract

Organizations are now placing applications where it makes the most sense to their business.  Whether on-premises, in a public or private cloud, or at the network’s edge, modern application flexibility supports evolving customer needs, capturing new opportunities, and driving differentiation in the market.

In this session, we will cover how Red Hat® Ansible Automation Platform enables a consistent experience using the same automation language from the data center to the public cloud and out to the edge while enabling organizations to scale automation in heterogeneous environments.
